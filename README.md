# Response Demo

This is a simple demonstration of a backend application using Node.js and Express.js. It includes various endpoints for serving JSON responses, obfuscated responses, and encrypted responses using a Caesar cipher.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   [git clone [https://github.com/Handy4ndy/responseDemo.git]
   ```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd backend-demo
   ```
### 3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install express
   ```
    
### 4. Start the server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```
### 5. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

   ## Explore the different endpoints:
         
          /server/message: Returns a JSON response from the server.
          /script/message: Returns a JSON response generated by the frontend script.
          /obfuscation/message: Returns an obfuscated JSON response.
          /cipher/message: Returns an encrypted JSON response using a Caesar cipher.
